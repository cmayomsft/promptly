# promptly-js

**Promptly is a personal/experimental SDK and is not a supported Microsoft product. Use at your own risk.**

**Promplty, like the Bot Builder SDK V4 it's based on, is in prerelease and subject to extensive change. Use at your own risk.**

## Overview
Promptly is a JavsScript/TypeScript library for building chat bots using the [Bot Builder SDK V4 for JavaScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js). 

Promptly provides an API for developing everything from complex, multi-turn topics of conversation to simple single-turn prompts in a simple and consistent way, so you can focus on your bot's conversational UI/UX (CUI) rather than the underlying details of conversation state and turn management.

## Packages
You can install the [promptly-bot package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promptly-bot) from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Getting Started
To get started, clone/fork this repo, open the alarmbot-ts folder in your editor, run `npm install`, and run/step through the [alarmbot-ts sample](samples/alarmbot-ts/) starting at [`app.ts`](samples/alarmbot-ts/src/app.ts).

A more detailed README is coming soon.
